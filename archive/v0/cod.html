      <h1>Concept of Code on Demand</h1>

          <h2>Definition</h2>
          <p>
            In distributed computing, code on demand is any technology that
            sends executable software code from a server computer to a client
            computer upon request from the client's software. Some well-known
            examples of the code on demand paradigm on the web are Java applets,
            Adobe's ActionScript language for the Flash Player, and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program code lies inactive on a web server until a user (client)
            requests a web page that contains a link to the code using the
            client's web browser. Upon this request, the web page and the
            program are transported to the user's machine using HTTP. When the
            page is displayed, the code is started in the browser and executes
            locally, inside the user's computer until it is stopped (e.g., by
            the user leaving the web page).
          </p>
          <p>
            Code on demand is a specific use of mobile code, within the field of
            code mobility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fuggetta et al, in their article in IEEE Transactions on Software
            Engineering in May 1998, gave an interesting example of Code On
            Demand (COD) with an daily kitchen example as following.

          <h2>Code on Demand in REST API</h2>
          <p>
            Roy Thomas Fielding, the father of REST API, discussed
            Code-On-Demand (COD in his dissertation for Doctor of Philosophy in
            Information and Computer Science
          </p>
          <p>He drafted out some advantages of COD:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The ability to add features to a deployed client,which provides
              for improved extensibility and configurability, and better user-
              perceived performance and efficiency when the code can adapt its
              actions to the client’s environment and interact with the user
              locally rather than through remote interactions
            </li>
            <li>
              Simplicity is reduced due to the need to manage the evaluation
              environment, but that may be compensated in some cases as a result
              of simplifying the client’s static functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scalability of the server is improved, since it can off-load work
              to the client that would otherwise have consumed its resources.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The main disadvantage of COD is the lack of visibility as the server
            sends code instead of simple data. This leads to security concern in
            deployment if the client cannot trust the servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            It allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and
            executing code in the form of applets or scripts. TThis simplifies
            clients by reducing the number of features required to be
            pre-implemented. Allowing features to be downloaded after deployment
            improves system extensibility. However, it also reduces visibility,
            and thus is only an optional constraint within REST.
          </p>
          <p>
            Code on Demand is the optional 6th constraint in REST. These are
            from his thesis

              REST allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and

              clients by reducing the number of features required to be

            </p>
            <p>
              The notion of an optional constraint may seem like an oxymoron.
              However, it does have a purpose in the architectural design of a
              system that encompasses multiple organizational boundaries. It
              means that the architecture only gains the benefit (and suffers
            </p>
            <p>
              the disadvantages) of the optional constraints when they are known
              to be in effect for some realm of the overall system.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if all of the client software within an organization
              is known to support Java applets [45], then services within that
              organization can be constructed such that they gain the benefit of
              enhanced functionality via downloadable Java classes. At the same
              time, however, the organization’s firewall may prevent the
              transfer of Java applets from external sources, and thus to the
              rest of the Web it will appear as if those clients do not support
              code-on-demand.
            </p>
            <p>
              An optional constraint allows us to design an architecture that
              supports the desired behavior in the general case, but with the
              understanding that it may be disabled within some contexts.

        <h2>Code on Demand and Security</h2>
        <p>
          Since JavaScript is nowaday the most popular web programming language.
          This section of security is discussing specifically about JavaScript
          security, including vulnerabilities and best practices.
        </p>
        <h3>Common JavaScript Front-End Security Vulnerability</h3>
        <p>
          These below are three security vulnerabilities common in front-end
          development. The list would be longer if back-end development with
          JavaScript is discussed.
        </p>
        <h5>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</h5>
        <p>
          In an XSS attack, the attacker injects a malicious client-side script
          into a web page. They usually achieve this by bypassing the
          same-origin policy of a website. As a result, the attacker can get
          access to user data and carry out actions on the user’s behalf.
        </p>
        <h5>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</h5>
        <p>
          CSRF attacks target authenticated (logged-in) users who are already
          trusted by the application. The attacker accesses a legitimate user’s
          account using the information found in session cookies and performs
          actions on their behalf without their knowledge or involvement. CSRF
          attacks are also known as session riding or one-click attacks.
        </p>
        <h5>Third-party security vulnerabilities</h5>
        <p>
          In front-end development, we use many third-party tools and libraries
          that are open to all kinds of JavaScript exploits. Some of these
          tools, such as React by Facebook, are developed and maintained by
          large corporations, and reliably fix issues and follow JavaScript
          security best practices. However, many of them are by indie developers
          or smaller teams that don’t always have the resources to regularly
          audit or update their code.
        </p>
        <h3>JavaScript security best practices</h3>
        To overcome these security vulnerabilities, the below best practices are
        suggested:
        <ul>
          <li>Use a JavaScript linter</li>
          <li>Audit dependencies using a package manager</li>
          <li>Add Subresource Integrity (SRI) checking to external scripts</li>
          <li>
            Avoid using inline JavaScript and establish a Content Security
            Policy
          </li>
          <li>Validate user input</li>
          <li>Escape or encode user input</li>
          <li>Use a CSRF token that’s not stored in cookies</li>
          <li>Ensure secure cookie transmission</li>
          <li>Minify, bundle, and obfuscate your JavaScript code</li>
        </ul>

      <h1>History of Code on Demand</h1>
      <p>
        We are now briefing through some options of COD including Java applet,
        Adobe Flash, Javascript and WebAssembly to cover the history of Code on
        Demand (COD).
      </p>

      <div class="container history--component">
        <h2>Java applet</h2>
        <p>
          Java applets were small applications written in the Java programming
          language, or another programming language that compiles to Java
          bytecode, and delivered to users in the form of Java bytecode. The
          user launched the Java applet from a web page, and the applet was then
          executed within a Java virtual machine (JVM) in a process separate
          from the web browser itself. A Java applet could appear in a frame of
          the web page, a new application window, Sun's AppletViewer, or a
          stand-alone tool for testing applets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its main disadvantages is to depend on a Java Runtime Environment
          (JRE), a complex and heavy-weight software package. They also normally
          required a plug-in for the web browser. Some organizations only allow
          software installed by an administrator. As a result, users were unable
          to view applets unless one was important enough to justify contacting
          the administrator to request installation of the JRE and plug-in.

        <h2>Adobe Flash</h2>
        <p>
          Adobe Flash Player (which is available on Microsoft Windows, macOS,
          and Linux) enables end users to view Flash content using web browsers.
          Adobe Flash Lite enabled viewing Flash content on older smartphones,
          but since has been discontinued and superseded by Adobe AIR.The
          ActionScript programming language allows the development of
          interactive animations, video games, web applications, desktop
          applications, and mobile applications. Programmers can implement Flash
          software using an IDE such as Adobe Animate, Adobe Flash Builder,
          Adobe Director, FlashDevelop, and Powerflasher FDT.

              HTML5 was released in 2008 by W3C. It included support for
              multimedia applications as well as consideration for low-level
              devices like mobile browsers. HTML5 ushered in the modern era of
              the web where full-fledged rich web applications can be developed
              without plugins. It took more than a decade for the older
              technologies like Java applets, ActiveX controls, and Flash to
              completely fade out.
            </p>
            <p>
              But, it all started with HTML5 that incorporated multiple web
              standards like HTML4, XHTML 1.0, and DOM Level 2.
            </p>
            <p>
              The adoption of HTML 5 and standard web APIs for rich web
              applications also brought JavaScript to the forefront. Previously,
              a variety of programming languages were used to program the web.
              Java for Java applets, any language for ActiveX control, and
              ActionScript for Flash. Previously JavaScript was used primarily
              to add some interaction to web pages.

          <h2>WebAssembly</h2>
          <p>
            WebAssembly (sometimes abbreviated Wasm) defines a portable
            binary-code format and a corresponding text format for executable
            programs[2] as well as software interfaces for facilitating
            interactions between such programs and their host environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main goal of WebAssembly is to enable high-performance
            applications on web pages, "but it does not make any Web-specific
            assumptions or provide Web-specific features, so it can be employed
            in other environments as well." It is an open standard and aims to
            support any language on any operating system, and in practice all of
            the most popular languages already have at least some level of
            support.

          <p>
            Announced in 2015 and first released in March 2017, WebAssembly
            became a World Wide Web Consortium recommendation on 5 December 2019
            and it received the Programming Languages Software Award from ACM
            SIGPLAN in 2021. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains the

          <p>WebAssembly is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              An improvement to JavaScript: Implement your performance critical
              stuff in wasm and import it like a standard JavaScript module.
            </li>
            <li>
              A new language: WebAssembly code defines an AST (Abstract Syntax
              Tree) represented in a binary format. You can author and debug in
              a text format so it’s readable.
            </li>
            <li>
              A browser improvement: Browsers will understand the binary format,
              which means we’ll be able to compile binary bundles that compress
              smaller than the text JavaScript we use today. Smaller payloads
              mean faster delivery. Depending on compile-time optimization
              opportunities, WebAssembly bundles may run faster than JavaScript,
              too!
            </li>
            <li>
              A Compile Target: A way for other languages to get first-class
              binary support across the entire web platform stack.
            </li>
